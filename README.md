# Unit 2 Lesson 5 Problem Set
## JavaScript Array Fundamentals

### Directions
There are two parts to this problem set:
* A written response section
* JavaScript Array exercises

**For Coding Exercises:**

1. From your project's root folder, run `npm install` to load project dependencies.

2. Your coding exercises live in the `problems` directory. Here, we have four files:
    * `exercises.js` Where you will code your solutions
    * `exercises.test.js` Your test file
    * `README.md` The instructions and prompts for your exercises.
    * `index.html`


3. Test your code often by running `npm test`. 

4. Check for style by running `eslint problems/exercises.js` in the terminal. If you get an error `eslint: command not found`, run `npm install -g eslint` first.

5. You are not done with your exercises until all tests pass and there are no eslint errors.

   **Note:** We have provided an `index.html` so that you can test and run your code in the browser and use Chrome Dev tools.

**For Short Responses:**

1. Your written response questions live in the `short-response.md` file.

2. Record your answers without removing the original questions.

3. Use complete sentences and style appropriately with markdown.
